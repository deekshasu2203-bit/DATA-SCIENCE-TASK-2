# Prodigy InfoTech Data Science Internship – Task 2

## 📌 Project Title
**Titanic Survival Prediction**

## 🧠 Objective
The goal of this project is to build a Machine Learning model that predicts whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster based on features such as age, gender, ticket class, and other passenger details.

## 📂 Dataset
The dataset used in this project is provided by **Prodigy InfoTech** on their official GitHub repository:

🔗 [Prodigy InfoTech Data Science Datasets – Task 2](https://github.com/Prodigy-InfoTech/data-science-datasets/tree/main/Task%202)

The dataset typically contains the following files:
- `train.csv` – training dataset with target labels.
- `test.csv` – test dataset for prediction.
- `gender_submission.csv` – sample submission file.

## 🧩 Workflow

### 1. Data Loading
- Load the dataset using pandas.
- Check for missing values and data types.

### 2. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
- Handle missing values.
- Encode categorical variables (e.g., Sex, Embarked).
- Normalize or scale numerical features if required.

### 3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Visualize survival rate by gender, class, age group, etc.
- Check correlations and feature importance.

### 4. Model Building
- Split the data into training and validation sets.
- Train models such as:
  - Logistic Regression  
  - Decision Tree  
  - Random Forest  
  - Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Compare performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

### 5. Evaluation
- Evaluate model performance on the validation set.
- Use confusion matrix and classification report for analysis.

### 6. Prediction
- Generate predictions on the test dataset.
- Save the submission file as `submission.csv`.

## 🧰 Technologies Used
- Python  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib / Seaborn  
- Scikit-learn  
- Jupyter Notebook
